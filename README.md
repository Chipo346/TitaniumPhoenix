# TitaniumPhoenix
A stylish proxy site with many features. Easy to modify and flows well.

#### Note to anyone who wants to modify

I am bad at organization so it's gonna look awful. Do anything you want to it.

#### Other basic info

I'm going to be updating this *hopefully* frequently and with new servers and some features. I know this isn't a super advanced thing but it's one of my first projects so yeah.

# Features

#### Locally Stored and Hosted Proxy Server

This allows your PhoenixHub site to have a proxy already equipped when you deploy it so you can quickly get to circumventing censorship!

#### Locally Stored YouTube Proxy

Since YouTube does not work on the Local Proxy, we came up with this as a solution. YouTube Proxy allows streaming of resolutions and framerates of 4K and 60 FPS, and will allow playback of any video and it uses YouTube's URL patterns for easy of use.

#### Games

This site has links to many games on a JSCDN for quick and efficient access.

#### Chatboxes

Chatboxes for TitaniumNetwork's Services. Replace if needed.
